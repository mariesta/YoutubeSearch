# Youtube Search
Simple React project to search and view Youtube's videos using the [Youtube Data Api](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started?authuser=1)

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a local copy on your machine which you can then run and use. These steps assumes you have npm installed already. If you don't, here is the [installation guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) to get started.

```
git clone https://github.com/mariesta/YoutubeSearch.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

Look for the line 'Project is running at [localhost url]'. If you navigate to this url, you should see this.
